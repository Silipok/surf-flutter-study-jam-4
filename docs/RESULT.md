  - Created `MagicBallApi` service for HTTP requests
  - Implemented `MagicBallRepository` for data abstraction
  - Added proper error handling and loading states
  - Real-time API calls return authentic Magic 8-Ball predictions

#### ✅ Task 4: Shake Detection
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Implementation**: Added shake detection using the `shake` package
- **Details**: 
  - Configurable shake sensitivity and timing
  - Works on mobile devices (shake gesture triggers prediction)
  - Integrated seamlessly with BLoC state management

#### ✅ Task 5: Multi-Platform Adaptation
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Implementation**: Responsive design for desktop, web, and tablet
- **Details**:
  - **Mobile**: Vertical layout optimized for touch interaction
  - **Tablet Portrait**: Enhanced layout with title and instructions
  - **Desktop/Tablet Landscape**: Side-by-side layout with explanatory text
  - **Web**: Fully functional in browser environment

### Advanced Features (🔥 Tasks)

#### ✅ Task 6 🔥: Ball Animations
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Implementation**: Multiple sophisticated animations
- **Details**:
  - **Floating Animation**: Ball smoothly floats up and down continuously
  - **Colored Shadow**: Dynamic shadow that changes color based on state
    - Purple shadow for normal state
    - Blue shadow during loading
    - Red shadow for errors
  - **Pulsating Effect**: Ball scales and pulses during loading state
  - **Smooth Transitions**: All animations use proper curves and timing

#### ✅ Task 10 🔥🔥: Animated Text Appearance
- **Status**: ✅ Completed  
- **Implementation**: Elegant text reveal animation
- **Details**:
  - Text fades in with opacity animation
  - Elastic scale animation creates engaging entrance effect
  - Smooth transition from loading to text display
  - Text shadow for better readability

## 🏗️ Architecture & Code Quality

### BLoC Architecture
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation between UI, business logic, and data layers
- **State Management**: Reactive programming with BLoC pattern
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data access with dependency injection
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback

### Modern Flutter Features
- **Dart 3 Compatibility**: Uses latest Dart features and syntax
- **Null Safety**: Full null safety implementation
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive code comments and documentation
- **Performance**: Optimized animations and efficient state management

## 🎨 Visual States

The app implements all required visual states as per the design specifications:

1. **Initial State**: Clean ball with no text, ready for interaction
2. **Loading State**: Darkened ball with pulsating animation and loading indicator
3. **Success State**: Answer text appears with smooth animation and purple glow
4. **Error State**: Red glow effect with error message

## 🚀 Platform Support

- ✅ **Android**: Full functionality including shake detection
- ✅ **iOS**: Complete feature set with native feel
- ✅ **Web**: Browser-compatible with responsive design
- ✅ **Desktop**: Optimized for mouse interaction and larger screens
- ✅ **Tablet**: Enhanced layouts for both portrait and landscape

## 📱 User Experience

### Interaction Methods
1. **Tap**: Touch/click the magic ball to get a prediction
2. **Shake**: Shake your mobile device to trigger prediction (mobile only)

### Visual Feedback
- Immediate loading state with pulsating animation
- Smooth text appearance with elastic animation
- Color-coded shadows for different states
- Responsive design adapts to screen size

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Flutter Dependencies
- `flutter_bloc`: State management
- `equatable`: Value equality for states/events  
- `http`: API communication
- `shake`: Shake detection for mobile devices

### Custom Rust Server
- **Framework**: Hyper for HTTP handling
- **Features**: CORS support, JSON responses, health checks
- **Predictions**: 21 classic Magic 8-Ball responses
- **Performance**: Fast, lightweight, and reliable
- **Location**: `/server` directory with full source code

### API Integration
- **Custom Server**: Built-in Rust web server for reliable predictions
- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3030/api`
- **Method**: GET request
- **Response**: JSON with prediction text (`{"reading": "It is certain"}`)
- **Error Handling**: Network timeouts, API errors, and connectivity issues
- **Fallback**: Self-hosted solution eliminates external API dependencies

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

While the core functionality is complete, the following advanced features could be added:

- **Task 7 🔥**: Settings screen for customization
- **Task 8 🔥**: Audio effects and sound settings
- **Task 9 🔥**: Text-to-speech for predictions
- **Task 11 🔥🔥🔥**: Parallax star effects
- **Custom animations**: Additional visual effects and transitions

## 🚀 Running the Development Environment

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start both server and Flutter app
./start_dev.sh        # macOS/Linux
start_dev.bat          # Windows
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Rust server
cd server
cargo run

# Terminal 2: Start Flutter app  
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Server Endpoints
- **API**: `http://localhost:3030/api` - Get predictions
- **Health**: `http://localhost:3030/health` - Server status
